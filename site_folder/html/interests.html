<hr>
<p>
I am a person whose interest is piqued by things complex and as simple as they can get. One of my favorite things to do to pass the time, or sometimes procrastinate 
is playing video games. I especially love playing the Nintendo&reg; Switch and my PS4. The games I spend most of my time playing are <a href="https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/index.html" target="blank">Super Smash Bros.&trade; Ultimate</a> 
and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/modernwarfare" target="blank">Call of Duty&reg;:Modern Warfare</a>. I find that when I don't really want to think anymore, or just need a break from studying or working, I will begin playing these games.
</p>

<p>
When I don't want to veg out anymore, I return to my active pursuit of knowledge in computer science and medical research. Everyday, I try to make sure I learn something new so that the complex questions that need answering, 
can one day be solved. I find that there are amazing resources on the internet that have helped in providing the fundamentals of many subjects. One of my favorite resources for a very long time in <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="blank">Khan Academy</a>. 
Sal Khan is a brilliant man that has changed the way of learning forever. I also like to use <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="blank">EdX</a> and <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/#!" target="blank">DataCamp</a> outside of my current educational resources. For a more personal touch on learning, I frequent many different
Youtubers that are professionals willing to teach those of us finding our way, video examples provided below. 
</p>

<p>
Ultlimately, I just love to learn, read, and challenge myself every day that I can. The only way to grow, in my opinion, is by continuously learning. Here is an excellent TedTalk on learning. I will also add in a few other videos of people that I watch for educational purposes. I like to refer to videos such as these so 
I can have an idea of what the field is like in the positions I hope to get. Along with understanding new scripting languages, learning new methods of programming, or just out of pure entertainment.
