<hr>
<p>
I am a person whose interest is piqued by things complex and as simple as they can get. One of my favorite things to do to pass the time, or sometimes procrastinate 
is playing video games. I especially love playing the Nintendo&reg; Switch and my PS4. The games I spend most of my time playing are <a href="https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/index.html" target="blank">Super Smash Bros.&trade; Ultimate</a> 
and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/modernwarfare" target="blank">Call of Duty&reg;:Modern Warfare</a>. I find that when I don't really want to think anymore, or just need a break from studying or working, I will begin playing these games.
</p>

<p>
When I don't want to veg out anymore, I return to my active pursuit of knowledge in computer science and medical research. Everyday, I try to make sure I learn something new so that the complex questions that need answering, 
can one day be solved. I find that there are amazing resources on the internet that have helped in providing the fundamentals of many subjects. One of my favorite resources for a very long time in <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="blank">Khan Academy</a>. 
Sal Khan is a brilliant man that has changed the way of learning forever. I also like to use <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="blank">EdX</a> and <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/#!" target="blank">DataCamp</a> outside of my current educational resources. For a more personal touch on learning, I frequent many different
Youtubers that are professionals willing to teach those of us finding our way, video examples provided below. 
</p>

<p>
Ultlimately, I just love to learn, read, and challenge myself every day that I can. The only way to grow, in my opinion, is by continuously learning. Here is an excellent TedTalk on learning. I will also add in a few other videos of people that I watch for educational purposes. I like to refer to videos such as these so 
I can have an idea of what the field is like in the positions I hope to get. Along with understanding new scripting languages, learning new methods of programming, or just out of pure entertainment.

My name is Kim Newman. I currently live in the Lynnwood area with my husband and son. I enjoy spending time with them and our small but spunky black lab, Cole. My husband is 
my best friend and we do everything together including running our businesses for the past 20 years. My son is a typical 15 year old who prefers to spend time on his computer 
talking to friends. As a family, we have become involved with the Nile Shrine and Shriners Children's Hospital.

<a href="https://www.nilenightmares.com/media.html" target="blank"><img src="../images/nilenightmares.png" alt="Nile Nightmares Haunted House Logo" class="floatleft"></a>
The past 2 years we have worked in the largest Nile Shrine fund raiser the Nile Nightmares Haunted House. I spend my time there selling tickets while my husband runs security. My 
son has the best job of getting into costume and scaring all the visitors. Selling tickets is really fun as I get to see the people coming in all worked up ready to be scared 
and I get to see them when our roaming actors come by and scare them. 
</p>
<p class="interests-right-text">
<img src="../images/hammock.jpg" alt="Boys Camping in Hammocks" class="floatright">You can often find us camping in the summer dragging our son and some friends out to the woods. We love to camp in Granite Falls where there is no cell phone reception. There 
we can unplug from technology and relax with friends. Our son can often be found surrounded by friends in their hammocks usually hanging from the same trees.
