My name is Demetrius Lee. I am originally from Sacramento, California, but moved up here back in 2013 for school and work. 
Now I reside in Mountlake Terrace with my fianc&eacute; and our dog and cat. You'll hear about them more soon. Education is my passion, along with my hobbies of video games and cinema.
</p>
<p class="home-text">
Originally, my goal was to pursue a medical degree and eventually become a reasearch physician. I started going to school at EdCC in 2013 before transferring to the University of Washington and getting a degree in Biochemistry.
Throughout my medical science studies, I found myself becoming infatuated with programming and computer science. Once I realized that the research projects I had in mind required a lot of programming knowledge, I began the journey of computing.
</p>
<p class="home-text">
Last year I returned to EdCC since I discovered that becoming a doctor wasn't my calling anymore and that maybe software development/engineering is where I need to be. 
After switching programs and enrolling in the Application Developer Certificate here at EdCC, I landed an IT internship. I have been able to put the things I have taught myself to use. 
</p>
<p class="home-text">

Aside from education and work, which takes up a great deal of my time, you may find me at home reading, playing video games, or watching the newest and greatest on Netflix or Hulu.
My dog and cat, Odin and Arya respectively, will always be found right mext to us when we get home. Odin is a Jack Russell Lhasa Apso mix, which I had not idea what the latter was until we got him. 
Makes for a very cute pup though! Click him if you would like to see more like him.
